# BattleShip

Two 10x10 grids. User places 5 ships of lengths—2, 3, 3, 4, 5 squares—onto their grid. May place the ships horizontally or vertically. On the other grid, the AI has 5 ships of the same lengths placed randomly. All ships must be within their grids and not overlap. AI’s ships are hidden from the user.  User and AI take turns hitting a square on each other’s grid. When a ship is hit, the square is marked as hit. Else, the square is marked as miss. The player who sinks all their opponent’s ships wins.
